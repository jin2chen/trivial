Type: select
Choices: generic: include all available drivers, targeted: only include drivers needed for this system
Description: Drivers to include in the initrd:
Extended_description: The primary function of an initrd is to allow the kernel to mount the root file system. It therefore needs to contain all drivers and supporting programs required to do that.\n\nA generic initrd is much larger than a targeted one and may even be so large that some boot loaders are unable to load it but has the advantage that it can be used to boot the target system on almost any hardware. With the smaller targeted initrd there is a very small chance that not all needed drivers are included.

Name: base-installer/initramfs/generator
Type: select
Choices: ${GENERATORS}
Description: Tool to use to generate boot initrd:

Extended_description: The '${GRUB}' package failed to install into /target/. Without the GRUB boot loader, the installed system will not boot.

Name: grub-installer/bootdev
Type: string
Description: Device for boot loader installation:
Extended_description: You need to make the newly installed system bootable, by installing the GRUB boot loader on a bootable device. The usual way to do this is to install GRUB on the master boot record of your first hard drive. If you prefer, you can install GRUB elsewhere on the drive, or to another drive, or even to a floppy.\n\nThe device should be specified as a device in /dev. Below are some examples:\n - "/dev/sda" will install GRUB to the master boot record of your first\n   hard drive;\n - "/dev/sda2" will use the second partition of your first hard drive;\n - "/dev/sdc5" will use the first extended partition of your third hard\n   drive;\n - "/dev/fd0" will install GRUB to a floppy.

Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Install GRUB?
Extended_description: GRUB 2 is the next generation of GNU GRUB, the boot loader that is commonly used on i386/amd64 PCs. It is now also available for ${ARCH}.\n\nIt has interesting new features but is still experimental software for this architecture. If you choose to install it, you should be prepared for breakage, and have an idea on how to recover your system if it becomes unbootable. You're advised not to try this in production environments.

Description: Install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record?
Extended_description: It seems that this new installation is the only operating system on this computer. If so, it should be safe to install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record of your first hard drive.\n\nWarning: If the installer failed to detect another operating system that is present on your computer, modifying the master boot record will make that operating system temporarily unbootable, though GRUB can be manually configured later to boot it.

Name: grub-installer/password
Type: password
Description: GRUB password:
Extended_description: The GRUB boot loader offers many powerful interactive features, which could be used to compromise your system if unauthorized users have access to the machine when it is starting up. To defend against this, you may choose a password which will be required before editing menu entries or entering the GRUB command-line interface. By default, any user will still be able to start any menu entry without entering the password.\n\nIf you do not wish to set a GRUB password, leave this field blank.

Description: Method for temporarily toggling between national and Latin input:
Extended_description: When the keyboard is in national mode and one wants to type only a few Latin letters, it might be more appropriate to switch temporarily to Latin mode.

Description: Method for toggling between national and Latin mode:
Extended_description: You will need a way to toggle the keyboard between the national layout and the standard Latin layout.\n\nRight Alt or Caps Lock keys are often chosen for ergonomic reasons (in the latter case, use the combination Shift+Caps Lock for normal Caps toggle).

Description: Logical Volume Management
Extended_description: A common situation for system administrators is to find that some disk partition (usually the most important one) is short on space, while some other partition is underused. The Logical Volume Manager (LVM) can help with this.\n\nLVM allows combining disk or partition devices ("physical volumes") to form a virtual disk ("volume group"), which can then be divided into virtual partitions ("logical volumes"). Volume groups and logical volumes may span several physical disks. New physical volumes may be added to a volume group at any time, and logical volumes can be resized up to the amount of unallocated space in the volume group.\n\nThe items on the LVM configuration menu can be used to edit volume groups and logical volumes. After you return to the main partition manager screen, logical volumes will be displayed in the same way as ordinary partitions, and should be treated as such.

Description: In order to start your new system, a so called boot loader is used.  It can be installed either in the master boot record of the first hard disk, or in a partition.  When the boot loader is installed in a partition, you must set the bootable flag for it. Such a partition will be marked with "${BOOTABLE}" in the main partitioning menu.

Name: partman-target/arch_help/ia64
Type: text
Description: In order to start your new system, the firmware on your Itanium system loads the boot loader from its private EFI partition on the hard disk.  The boot loader then loads the operating system from that same partition.  An EFI partition has a FAT16 file system formatted on it and the bootable flag set. Most installations place the EFI partition on the first primary partition of the same hard disk that holds the root file system.

Description: Help on partitioning
Extended_description: Partitioning a hard drive consists of dividing it to create the space needed to install your new system.  You need to choose which partition(s) will be used for the installation.\n\nSelect a free space to create partitions in it.\n\nSelect a device to remove all partitions in it and create a new empty partition table.\n\nSelect a partition to remove it or to specify how it should be used. At a bare minimum, you need one partition to contain the root of the file system (whose mount point is /).  Most people also feel that a separate swap partition is a necessity.  "Swap" is scratch space for an operating system, which allows the system to use disk storage as "virtual memory".\n\nWhen the partition is already formatted you may choose to keep and use the existing data in the partition.  Partitions that will be used in this way are marked with "${KEEP}" in the main partitioning menu.\n\nIn general you will want to format the partition with a newly created file system.  NOTE: all data in the partition will be irreversibly deleted.  If you decide to format a partition that is already formatted, it will be marked with "${DESTROY}" in the main partitioning menu.  Otherwise it will be marked with "${FORMAT}".\n\n${ARCHITECTURE_HELP}

Description: for internal use; can be preseeded
Extended_description: Adjust the policy for starting and ending alignment of new partitions.  You can generally leave this alone unless optimal alignment causes some kind of problem.\n\nCylinder alignment was required by very old DOS-era systems, and is not usually needed nowadays.  However, a few buggy BIOSes may try to calculate cylinder/head/sector addresses for partitions and get confused if partitions aren't cylinder-aligned.\n\nMinimal alignment ensures that new partitions are aligned to physical blocks on the disk, avoiding performance degradation that may occur with cylinder alignment particularly on modern disks.\n\nOptimal alignment ensures that new partitions are aligned to a suitable multiple of the physical block size, guaranteeing optimal performance.

Description: for internal use; can be preseeded
Extended_description: Normally, filesystems are mounted using a universally unique identifier (UUID) as a key; this allows them to be mounted properly even if their device name changes. UUIDs are long and difficult to read, so, if you prefer, the installer can mount filesystems based on the traditional device names, or based on a label you assign. However, note that traditional device names may change based on the order in which the kernel discovers devices at boot, which may cause the wrong filesystem to be mounted; similarly, labels are likely to clash if you plug in a new disk or a USB drive, and if that happens your system's behaviour when started will be random.\n\nIf you set "label" here, any filesystems without a label will be mounted using a UUID instead.\n\nDevices with stable names, such as LVM logical volumes, will continue to use their traditional names rather than UUIDs.
